I contributed to several aspects of this project. First, I did step 0, creating the skeleton website, of the project guidelines. While creating the skeleton page, I also created skeleton code for views.py, urls.py, and admin.py as well as the templates folder with the html files from the first project.

Once the models.py and init.py had been written but not running, Emily and I went through each of the files so that we could run one model and view the attributes. After we solved the issue for one model, I went through all the other modelsin models.py to fix many of the small errors, such as misspelled words and missing fields, so that all models could be used with init.py. This process required a decent amount of editing to init.py and models.py to allow for init.sh to run. 

After init.sh and the models were complete, I helped implement the UI by writing the data queries for each html file and mapping the urls in urls.py. In addition, I helped Jay create the base_generic.html and edit a few of the html files so that the data could be rendered.
