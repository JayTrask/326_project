I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I fixed issues with the admin page by modifying and debugging the song and song instance models which prevented data from loading in our templates.

In addition, I also worked on the base generic html file so that the logo in the static images folder was loading properly on each template page.

Lastly, I did some last minute polishing of the UI by going through each template and making sure the size of text and table views remained consistent throughout the website. I also added some missing link URLs so that every link on the prototype application loaded a page.
