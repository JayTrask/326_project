I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I helped design each of the models used in are application specificially the playlist model. I also fixed issues with the admin page later on by debugging the song and song instance models which prevented data from loading in our templates.

In addition, I also worked on the base generic html file so that the logo in the static images folder was loading properly on each template page. I helped link URLs to their respective page so that all links on the prototype application loaded a page.

Lastly, I did some last minute polishing of the UI by going through each template and making sure the size of text and table views remained consistent throughout the website, and fixed some formatting issues which made the html files difficult to read.
