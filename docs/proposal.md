# Innovative Idea

HiveList is a collaborative playlist builder. The application will be built on top of the spotify API. The objective of the application is to allow several people to build a playlist together, vote on which songs should be added to the playlist, and eventually export the playlist to spotify.

# Important Data

HiveList will implement the following datasets:
* Spotify Data: 
    Using simple REST principles we will use data in the Spotify API to get songs/song demos, searching features.
* User Data: 
    Users will need to log into our system, so we will have their email addresses that they want linked to their account and also their password.
* Playlist Data: 
    Each playlist will be made of a list of songs, which includes artist, who contributed it to the playlist, the date added, length of song, and popularity.
    * Voting Data:
    Each song added to a playlist will be voted on by the users, so we'll have to keep a tally of that, in both percentage and raw form.
    * Statistical Data (Top songs, Playlists, etc.):
    This is based off the user's activity on the website. It will contain their preferences for music, the amount of time they've listed to the playlist, and the songs they add to playlists most.
