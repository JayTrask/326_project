	Mainly for this submission, I worked closely on the models to ensure that they worked correctly and the database flow was correct. I added fields to relations and added new tables so that we could get the data we need in order for our app to function the way we want it to. I also helped my teammates understand how the relational flow works for our data and why we need certain tables and fields.
	I also wrote the init.py script so we could see our database in action and make any changes we needed to make. It populates each of the database models with the needed fields and they are displayed on the admin site with the help of views, urls, and admin.
	I helped somewhat with views, urls, and admin to get those to display the database that I populated, but I wasnt much help with those. At least I could help my groupmates by telling them what not to do testing out ideas they had.
