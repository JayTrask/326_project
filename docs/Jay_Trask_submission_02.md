Throughout this project submission, I worked on several aspects of our project, including the Templates, Views, and models.
Most of the work was done in conjuction with other members, which will be outlined in the description of my contributions
below.

I began this submission by transitioning our mock UI webpages to templates in the django format. I did this byside Caleb,
where we began with the page with the most 'variables' that would be needed to complete it, the homepage. Figuring this
template out together laid the groundwork for us to smoothly make each other html file a template. After this we were able
to abstract away everything that is consistent across all webpages and made a base_generic template that each file extended.

Simultaneously I worked on my portion of the models.py file. I began by creating the contributor as well as vote instance 
model; after this, I worked on refining the remaining models, specifically altering alongside Caleb and Omar which 
variables were needed for each model, and communicating those changes to the members who were working on the data model 
diagram. Views was the final piece I worked on, starting off by defining variables from the templates in the home view and communicating
that through the context portion of the views. Much of the rest of the views was done by the remainder of the team.

Finally, I would like to include that much of my work in this project involved tweaking and fixing prior code that we 
already had. I made sure to check over everyones work alongside caleb and emily and refine anything that did not
translate through our project. The last thing I did for the project submission was to create a script for our 
team video submission.
