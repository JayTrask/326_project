I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I worked on the user views so that currently logged in users could view data associated with their account. Specifically, I worked on the home page, and the mylist page

In addition, I also made some changes to the playlist model, views, and admin page in order to disassociate completed playlists from playlists that are still being voted on 

Lastly, I worked on the user registration form template as well as other templates around the site to make formatting easier to read. I was also responsible for creating the demo video for our app.
