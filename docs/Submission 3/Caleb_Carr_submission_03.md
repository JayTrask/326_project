I contributed to several aspects of this project. First, Jay and I worked together to add the few pieces of code that allowed for user authentication. Once we were able to add users, I worked on faking the users in init.py and adding playlists to each user.

 
In addition, I worked on displaying the data associated with a user. Specifically, I worked on the profile page to display the user's information and the playlists associated with the user. Also, I worked on creating the form to allow a user to change their password on the profile page.

   
Lastly, I worked on creating the form to make a new account. In addition, I worked on various small bugs to make sure the site was running properly.
