	For this project submission I worked on a few things. First I worked on extending the user model, but that proved to be futile as I couldnt get it to work and we ended up just using Djangos default user model. I ahd also changed our fake data creation to work with our hopeful new model, but that had to be reverted as well. Finally for the user data, I added the functionality to fake users and added their full interaction with the other data models, so each playlist had a creator and each song_instance had an adder and each vote_instance had a voter.
	Next, I worked on just going through each html page and fixing inconsistencies. In some of the pages we had columns that had labels saying one thing while the data in that column was different, so I just changed the labels or queries and made sure that they were all consistent.
	Finally I worked on putting some users in groups with different permissions because that was part of the project requirements to turn in, but then Professor Richards said we dont need any groups more than admin and regular users, so that was scrapped as well before I did much work. For this submission most of my work ended up being moot either because it wasnt worth the time we would have to wait and it was better to just use something that was already given to use, or becuase we ended up not needing it.
