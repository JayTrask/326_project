#### Yay! Submission 3 is done!For this part of the project, I worked on three specific parts:I worked on writing up the team write up and script for the video (along with Emily Earl). For the script, we went through every page of the website and tried to boil it down to specific parts that Omar could easily mention in his video. We tried to organize it, so the video would best display the website's functionality. For the team write up, we viewed the previous submission, and we determined the best way to describe the functionality of the website. I help organize the "make new account" page. Caleb was able to generate a Django page that allowed a user to make new account, but for some reason, the formatting for the help comments were all wrapped around each input field. I went through and removed the help comments and shifted over the inputs, so the page was more visually pleasing. From there, Omar helped with removing the password help texts (by stop auto-generating the page from Django), so that the whole page was formatted correctly. Finally, I helped implement the log out functionality. I added the log out button to the right of the nav bar on all pages of the website, and had it reroute the user to Welcome page. However, my code was not properly logging out the user, so with the help of my team mates, we were able to add the proper code to correctly log out the user.
