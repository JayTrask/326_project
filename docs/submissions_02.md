# ﻿﻿Overview:HiveList is a collaborative playlist builder. The application allows several users to collectively build a playlist by voting on which songs they believe should be added. The users can also the playlist’s settings. Finally, the website also implements features which allow users to explore popular songs/playlists, keep track of recently played playlist, and the ability to change one's profile information. There were no major changes in the base idea from project proposal.# Team Members: Caleb Carr, Collin Giguere, Emily Earl, Jay Trask, Olivia Higgins, Omar Sanchez# Video Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNSnfXl1ZjU# Design Overview: A design overview of your data model as implemented in Django, the important URL routes, and the implemented UI views. Please provide enough detail to demonstrate your team’s understanding of the material.# Problems/Successes:## Problems:When we began coding up , we ran into quite a few implementation problems. The main implementation problem was our original design of how the different data models would interact with each other. Our original design for how the different data models would interact with each other ended up being drastically different from our end design. This change come from many revision to our original idea, and painstakingly changing the code accordingly (shoutout to Caleb here). It was difficult to coordinate the many different aspects of the website. However, what resulted was a well designed UI. ## Successes:Our team was really able to collaborate productively on project 2. We used trello, web-based project management application, to help organize and assign tasks. We also strived to meet most Sunday afternoons to collaborate in person. Finally, we divided tasks among depending on where our individual talents lie, which greatly helped the development of the website. Although we had to go through countless revisions, we were successful in populating our databases with mock data and linked URL routes in our navigation bar and throughout our website. Although there was a learning curve on using ORM tools, we were able functional website that uses [mock] data that has easy navigational access.## What we can improveMoving forward, we discussed meeting earlier and more frequently to keep track of each member's progress. Especially as the website development becomes increasingly difficult, we work together more. To further develop and evolve our website, we need to work more on user authentication and authorization on our log in page. We would investigate further into how we could use Spotify's API to provide playlist data.
