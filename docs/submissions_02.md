﻿# Overview: HiveList is a collaborative playlist builder. The application allows several users to collectively build a playlist by voting on which songs they believe should be added. The users can also the playlist’s settings. Finally, the website also implements features which allow users to explore popular songs/playlists, keep track of recently played playlist, and the ability to change one's profile information. There were no major changes in the base idea from project proposal.# Team Members: Caleb Carr, Collin Giguere, Emily Earl, Jay Trask, Olivia Higgins, Omar Sanchez# Video Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNSnfXl1ZjU# Design Overview: A design overview of your data model as implemented in Django, the important URL routes, and the implemented UI views. Please provide enough detail to demonstrate your team’s understanding of the material.# Problems/Successes:## Problems:Team problemsWhen we began coding up , we ran into quite a few implementation problems## Successes:Our team was really able to collaborate productively on project 2. We used trello, web-based project management application, to help organize and assign tasks. We also were able to meet most Sunday afternoons to collaborate in person. ## What we can improveMoving forward, we discussed meeting earlier and more frequently to keep track of each member's progress. Especially as the website development becomes increasingly difficult, we work together more. To future develop and evolve our website, we need to work more on user authentication and authorization on our log in page. We would investigate further into how we could use Spotify's API to provide playlist data.Problems/Successes: A brief overview of the problems and successes your team encountered.
